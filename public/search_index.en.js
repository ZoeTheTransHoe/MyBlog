While it did run Debian 12 before on its archaic 320GB Spinning HDD, this new SSD should modernize it and make it.\nSo whats more taxing for this computer and me than running a bloated OS and an OS you have to compile everything for (including sanity)? Using both at the same time! \nThis blog will entail the steps I took to dualboot Windows 10 and Gentoo Linux, using the KDE Desktop Environment, on Systemd with Flatpak, Wayland and Pipewire/Portals support.\n\n The Specimen \nFor this demonstration, I will be installing Gentoo/Windows onto my HP Elitebook G820. The Specs Are:\n\n    CPU: Intel i5-4300U \n    RAM: 8GB DDR3\n    GPU: Intel HD 4400\n    Drive Space: 120GB SSD\n\n Preparations \nTo start, you will need 3 things downloaded from another computer.\n\n     A Windows 10 ISO. This can be obtained from  Microsoft's Offical Website.  \n     A Live Linux USB for installing Gentoo from. While you are free to use other Linux Distros, since Gentoo can be bootstrapped from pretty much any exisiting Linux Distro, I will be using the official Gentoo Minimal USB, so I only have a CLI interface to reduce overhead - important for when we are full speed ahead compiling software later!  You can grab the Gentoo Minimal Live USB Here.\n     A USB Stick, and Ventoy for putting both the ISO files onto one USB Stick.\n\nOnce you have obtained all of these files, we can get started!\n Getting Setup \nThe next steps is getting Ventoy setup. This will slightly difference on if you are on Windows Or Linux. If you already know how to use Ventoy you can skip to here.\n Linux \n\n     Download the Linux tar.gz from here\n     Extract the file once it is done downloading, and enter the extracted file created. It should look something like this.\n    \n     Run the file named \"VentoyGUI.x86_64\". You may need to make it executable, which can be done by right clicking on it and checking its properties if you are using GNOME or KDE, or running the following command:\n     sudo chmod +x ./VentoyGUI.x86_64 \n     In the following window, select your USB stick in the button labelled 1, and click \"Install\" on the button labelled 2. Press OK on the following two windows that popup.\n    \n     Now Ventoy Is Installed, navigate to the new partition named \"Ventoy\", and place both the Windows and Gentoo ISOs in this partition. Once they are added, remove the USB drive from your computer and place it into the system you wish to install the two OSes onto. \n    \n    \n\n Windows \n\n     Download the Windows zip from here.\n     Extract the file once it is done downloading, and enter the extracted file created. It should look something like this.\n    \n     Run the file named \"Ventoy2Disk\" . UAC will prompt you if you want to run the app.\n     In the following window, select your USB stick in the button list at the top and click \"Install\" at the bottom. Press OK on the following two windows that popup.\n    \n     Now Ventoy Is Installed, navigate to the new partition named \"Ventoy\", which should be your D:\\ or similar, and then place both the Windows and Gentoo ISOs in this partiton. Once they are added, remove the USB drive from your computer and place it into the system you wish to install the two OSes onto. \n    \n\nOnce Ventoy Is Installed, Boot up the target machine and boot into the Ventoy USB using your computers boot menu. Navigate down to the Windows ISO using the arrow keys and press enter twice. Now go ahead and get Windows 10 installed. Do not attempt to rush ahead and install Gentoo first, it is much less hassle and headache to install Windows 10 first then install Gentoo (this really goes for dualbooting any Windows and Linux).\nIf you are reading this, I am guessing you know how to install Windows 10. Its not a pleasant installer but its easy all things considered. \nOnce Windows 10 is installed, make sure to disable fast boot as it can mess with booting our other Linux install. This can be done by:\n\n     Search For \"Edit Power Plan\" in the search bar. \n    \n     Go To \"Power Options\" in the top bar \n     Click \"Choose what the power buttons do\" \n    \n     Click on \"Change Settings that are currently unavailable \n    \n     Untick \"Turn on fast start-up\" and Save Changes\n\nBefore we head into Gentoo, we need to shrink Windows 10s partition so we have room to install Gentoo onto.\n\n     Search For \"Disk Management\" in the search bar.\n    \n     Left-Click on your Windows 10 C: Partition, and press shrink volume \n    \n     Enter in your desired size in MBs of your Gentoo Partition.\n     Once shrunk, you should have your C drive and some free space - it should look something like the below:\n    \n\nNow, Windows is setup and configured correctly, its time for the fun part!\n Gentoo Time! \nReboot your machine back into Ventoy, and load into the Gentoo Live USB. The rest of this guide will be written in mind that you are using the Gentoo Live USB.\nWhen prompted, enter in the keycode for your specific keymap (for me, that is uk), and wait for Gentoo to load up and you get into a shell prompt.\n Set Up Internet Access \nIf you are on ethernet, you can skip this step. However, for my fellow wifi enthusiast, follow the following steps to get connected to your wifi network.\n\n     Run the following command to find your wifi card.\n     livecd ~ # iwconfig \n    The command should output an interface name that is followed by IEEE 802.11 - thats your wireless interface, write it down.\n     Run the following command to find the ESSIDs (network names) the wireless card can run, replacing \"YOUR_WIFI_INTERFACE_HERE\" with the interface name obtained in the previous step.\n    livecd ~ #  iwlist YOUR_WIFI_INTERFACE_HERE scan | grep ESSID\n    You should be able to see the network name of the wifi network you wish to connect too.\n     Add your wifi networks credentials using this command, replacing YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK with your wifi network's ESSID, and YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD with the password of your network.\n    livecd ~ # wpa_passphrase YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD | tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n     Connect to your wifi network using the following command replacing \"YOUR_WIFI_INTERFACE_HERE\" with your interface name.\n     livecd ~ # wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i YOUR_WIFI_INTERFACE_HERE It should spit out Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant\n     Done! Run a Ping command to ensure you can access the outside world.  livecd ~ # ping google.com \n\nNow, lets jump into the main cheese and biscuits. Grab some cheese and biscuits actually, and get comfortable, this is gonna be a long process. \nMost of this will be ripped from the  Gentoo Wiki.. However, this guide will be a more focused, full guide to get from TTY &gt; Full KDE Desktop will all the trimmings, while dualbooting Windows, compared to the Gentoos wiki being more generic. You are free to use either wikis, or both.\nLets get started!\n Prepare Disks! \nRun the following to get the storage devices detected by the system - make double sure you pick out the drive that corresponds to the drive you want to install Gentoo onto!\nlivecd ~ # lsblk \nThis drive will usually be /dev/sda or /dev/nvme01. Run the following to start the partitioning tool, replacing MY_DRIVE with the drive you wish to install Gentoo Linux onto. \nlivecd ~ # cfdisk MY_DRIVE \nCreate Two New Partitions in the empty space we created in Windows before hand.:\n\n Swap Partition, about the same size as RAM.\n Root Partition, rest of the disk\n\nMake the swap partition a Swap type, and write and quit cfdisk.Once back in the terminal prompt, run lsblk again to identify which partition is the swap and root, and note this down - it'll come in handy a lot later! \nlivecd ~ # lsblk\nRun the following three commands to format the two new parititons and setup swap \nlivecd ~ # mkfs.ext4 /dev/YOUR_ROOT\nlivecd ~ # mkswap /dev/YOUR_SWAP\nlivecd ~ # swapon /dev/YOUR_SWAP\nMount the root partition using the following command\nlivecd ~ # mount /dev/YOUR_ROOT /mnt/gentoo\nChange into the directory of your new mounted root\nlivecd ~ # cd /mnt/gentoo\n Installing Stage3 \nNow we can install the Stage3 tarball, that will contain the foundation of our new Gentoo install. There are many foundations - those who want no desktop, or looking to run a desktop, those wanting to use a different init system or CPU architectures e.t.c. For this guide, we want a desktop on systemd and AMD64. To get the latest tarball, we can go over to https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/, and copy the link on \"Stage3 desktop profile | systemd.\"\n\nBack in our terminal, we will paste in the following command to grab us this tarball, where STAGE3_DOWNLOAD_LINK is the link we copied from earlier.\nlivecd ~ # wget STAGE3_DOWNLOAD_LINK\nNow, we could just assume it all downloaded properly - but lets be safe rather than sorry! Run the following command to get the SHA512 signature and compare it to the tar.xz we just downloaded. \nlivecd ~ # wget STAGE3_DOWNLOAD_LINK.sha256\nlivecd ~ # sha256sum --check YOUR_TAR_FILE.sha256\nYou should get a:\nYOUR_TAR_FILE : OK\nNow the fun (and slightly long) part - copy in the next command to extract the stage3 file.\nlivecd ~ # tar xpvf stage3-*.tar.xz --xattrs-include='*.*' --numeric-owner\n Configuring Compilation \nNow, we can start editing the big important make.conf file - the file that dictate how the software we download later will be compiled. Make sure you take care editing this file! \nOpen up the file using whatever text editor you desire- I will use Vi, but if you hate God you can use Emacs or Nano.\nlivecd ~ # vi /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf\nIn COMMON_FLAGS, add the following:\nCOMMON_FLAGS=\"-march=native -O2 -pipe\"\nMAKEOPTS will define how many threads will be used to compile our software - a good rule of thumb is for the number of jobs is either the number of threads in your PC or the amount of memory in GBs you have divide by 2, whichever is lower.  The load-average will be the job count + 2. \nOn my machine, I will have 4 threads and 8GBs, so will make my job count 4 and my load count 6, for example.\nAdd the following line to your make.conf, substituting 4 and 6 with the appropriate number of jobs/load averages for your machine:\nMAKEOPTS=\"-j4 -l6\"\nSave and exit the file. Lets move onto the next step!\n Entering New System \nNow we have the configuration for compiling our software, we can enter our new environment. To do so, we need to copy over our DNS info, then chroot into the new environment. To do so, enter in the following two commands.\nlivecd ~ # cp --dereference /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/\nNOTE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL NOT WORK IF YOU ARE NOT USING OFFICIAL GENTOO INSTALL MEDIA - PLEASE LOOK HERE IF YOU ARE NOT DOING SO\nlivecd ~ # arch-chroot /mnt/gentoo\nYou should now see your prompt change to \nlivecd / #\nTo initalize entering in the new environment, enter in the next 2 commands.\nlivecd / # source /etc/profile  \nlivecd / # export PS1=\"(chrOwOt) ${PS1}\" \n Preparing Bootloader \nThese steps will be different if your system is either UEFI (has an EFI partition) or Legacy BIOS (doesn't have an EFI partition). My machine is so ancient it uses Legacy BIOS, but for conviences sake I will leave both sets of commands needed to mount the boot\n UEFI Systems \nlivecd / # mkdir /efi  \nlivecd / # mount /dev/EFI_PARTITON /efi  \n Legacy BIOS Systems \nNo Additional Steps Needed at this point.\n Preparing Portage \nPortage will be our package management system, managing compilation, updating and removing software from our system. \nThe first thing we shall do is sync with portage, to make sure the software repository is up to date. This can be done by:\nlivecd / # emerge-webrsync  \nlivecd / # emerge --sync  \nNow we need to pick our profile - i.e, some extra building blocks to help build the system we want in the end. Since we want to use KDE Plasma with systemd on a desktop, we can pick option 28 - amd64/23.0/desktop/plasma/systemd\nlivecd / # eselect profile set 28  \nNow for the fun part - configuring USE! These are the flags that define which features we do and do not want for the software we are downloading. \nTo set the USE flags, open the make.conf file again.\nlivecd / # vi /etc/portage/make.conf\nFor our KDE/Wayland/Pipewire/Systemd setup, copy in the following USE flags - you are however, free to tweak them as you see fit!\nUSE=\"-gtk -gnome -cdr -dvd -browser-integration -crash-handler -firewall -handbook -sdk -thunderbolt -wacom -wallpapers -webengine -ieee1394 -jack-client accessibility colord bluetooth qt5 kde alsa crypt cups desktop-portal discover display-manager flatpak grub kwallet legacy-systray networkmanager plymouth pulseaudio sddm smart systemd X xwayland dbus ffmpeg sound-server wifi policykit jack-sdk pipewire-alsa extra dracut mount python\"\nNow we need to add the CPU/GPUs we will be using to our Portage configuration.\nFor our CPUs, run the following commands to download the program that will parse and then add our supported CPU Flags.\nlivecd / # emerge --ask --oneshot cpuid2cpuflags\nlivecd / # echo \"*/* $(cpuid2cpuflags)\" &gt; /etc/portage/package.use/00cpu-flags\nFor our GPUS, this will depend on if you use Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA. I am using Intel Haswell (Gen 7) iGPU on this machine, for AMD see here, and for Nvidia (FOSS) see here, and for Nvidia (Proprietary) see here.\nIn any case, add the following line in make.conf, with your specific video card flags.\nVIDEO_CARDS=\"intel\"\nNext, we will add to out make.conf, we need to add the software liscenses we want to use. Since the FSF dont have a gun to my head, I will add it to allow any license in the make.conf.\nACCEPT_LICENSE=\"*\"\nNow, lets update emerge to make use of all of these lovely new flags. This will take a long time, especially since - it took me around 8 hours on my shitty Elitebook!\nlivecd / # emerge --ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse @world\nThen remove unneeded dependencies by running the following\nlivecd / # emerge --depclean \n Configuring Locales / Keymaps \nFirst, lets configure which time zone we are in. First, lets check the timezone file to see what options we have.\nGenerally, the timezone for you will be your capital city in your country, in the continent you live in. \nlivecd / # ls -l /usr/share/zoneinfo\nSince I live in the UK, it will therefore be in Europe/London. To tell systemd to use this, make a symbolic link between this timezone and the file it looks for, for localetime, replacing YOUR_TIME_ZONE with your specific time zone. \nlivecd / # ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/YOUR_TIME_ZONE /etc/localtime\nTo configure locales, first check the below file for the possible locales that can be used \nlivecd / # vim /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED \nOnce you have found the locale you wish to use, close that file then open up the locale generation file, and add the locales you wish to use.\nlivecd / # vim /etc/locale.gen\n\nen_GB ISO-8859-1\nen_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8\nSave and exit that file, and run the command to generate the new locales.\nlivecd / # locale-gen\nNow update your new locales.\nlivecd / # env-update &amp;&amp; source /etc/profile &amp;&amp; export PS1=\"(chrOwOt) ${PS1}\"\n Installing a Kernel. \nWhile we have a lot of useful tools so far, we are missing the most important of all - the kernel! While we could configure our own kernel and you are more than welcome to do so, for this guide I will fall back and use the binary kernel for the sake of time.\nFirst, download the firmware needed by the kernel:\nlivecd / # emerge --ask linux-firmware sof-firmware\nFor Intel CPUs, download microcode updates too:\nlivecd / # emerge --ask intel-microcode\nNow, lets install the Kernel\nlivecd / # emerge --ask gentoo-kernel-bin\n  Configuring filesystems. \nWhile we could manually edit our own fstab (the partitions Linux will automount while booting) ourselves, we could nab the tool Arch Linux uses to do this automatically for its install guide.\nFirst, download git so we can download the fstab generation script from GitHub\nlivecd / # emerge --ask dev-vcs/git\nNow clone the git repo that contains genfstab\nlivecd / # cd tmp\nlivecd / # git clone https://github.com/glacion/genfstab.git\nlivecd / # cd genfstab\nChange to a different TTY (Ctrl + Alt + F2) and the following command\nlivecd ~ # /mnt/gentoo/tmp/genfstab/genfstab -U /mnt/gentoo &gt;&gt; /mnt/gentoo/etc/fstab\nSwitch back to the TTY in our new install chroot (Ctrl + Alt + F1)\n  Setting System information \nSince we are running systemd, we can run the following commands to setup systemd for our system.\nlivecd / # systemd-machine-id-setup\nlivecd / # systemd-firstboot --prompt\nlivecd / # systemctl preset-all --preset-mode=enable-only\nTo make using the terminal slightly more tolerable later, we can download auto-completion tools for our shell, bash.\nlivecd / # emerge --ask bash-completion\nTo enable time sync using systemd, run the following command\nlivecd / # systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service\nOther useful tools we can download now includes udev-rules for dealing with some storage device types, and wpa_supplicant so we have a fallback to connect to the interent later.\nlivecd / # emerge --ask iw wpa_supplicant io-scheduler-udev-rules\n  Configuring the bootloader \nThis step will be slightly different deepening on if you are using BIOS or UEFI systems. \nIf you are on UEFI, run the following command (BIOS Chads do not need to do this.)\nlivecd / # echo 'GRUB_PLATFORMS=\"efi-64\"' &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/make.conf\nBoth UEFI and BIOS users, run the following command to grab grub and os-prober.\nlivecd / # emerge --ask grub os-prober\n\nNow run the following commands (depending on if you are on UEFI or BIOS)\n UEFI Systems \nlivecd / # grub-install --efi-directory=/efi\n\n BIOS Systems \nlivecd / # grub-install /dev/YOUR_DRIVE\nBy default, GRUB will not search for other partitions - including our Windows 10 partition. To allow it to do so, open up the following file\nlivecd / # vim /etc/default/grubprober\nAnd add the following line at the end GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false \nNow we can tell grub to configure itself, includin which  partitions it lists at boot time.\nlivecd / # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg \n  Daily Use Administration \nNow the fun part - adding your user and adding in the software we will use on a desktop - that means KDE, Pipewire e.t.c!\nFirst lets add a normal user and give them a password. You can replace zelda with whatever name you desire.\nlivecd / # useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio,video -s /bin/bash zelda\nlivecd / # passwd zelda\nAs a security measure, lets disable root login.\nlivecd / # passwd -dl root \nNow, to let our user perform access that needs super user access, lets install sudo and configure it to allow our user to run commands as super user.\nlivecd / # emerge --ask sudo \nQuick aside - if you are using vim/emacs, you might notice sudoedit doesn't work and complains about not having nano available\neselect editor list\neselect editor set 1\n. /etc/profile\nOpen up the sudo configuration file\nlivecd / # sudoedit /etc/sudoers \nUncomment this line\n# %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  \nSave and exit this file.Now for the fun part - installing our audio system and Desktop environment. Be warned, this will take a very long time to compile, so hang in there, and grab a beverage while it does so.\nRun the following command to start the big merge:\nlivecd / # emerge --ask pipewire wireplumber plasma-meta konsole kde-apps/dolphin  \nNow, to exit the live medium, run the following commands to exit the chroot, unmount all partitions and reboot the computer\nlivecd / # exit \nlivecd ~ # cd \nlivecd ~ # umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}  \nlivecd ~ # umount -R /mnt/gentoo  \nlivecd ~ # reboot  \nRemove USB stick while the PC is rebooting - you should now be greeted by GRUB!\nReboot into both OSes, then once in Gentoo log in with your users credentials and run the following command to enable SDDM\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo systemctl enable --now sddm  \nOnce in KDE, you may notice there is no sound, bluetooth or networking. Dont panic, just run the following commands to enable NetworkManager, Bluetooth and Pipewire\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo systemctl enable --now -user wireplumber pipewire pipewire-pulse  \nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager bluetooth \nFinally, add Flathub to your flatpak repos so you can use flatpaks.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo \nDone!\n\n  Extras For Gentoo \n  Install Hyfetch :3 \nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask hyfetch \n  Use Samba Shares \nOpen the make.conf file again, and add the samba USE flag.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo vim /etc/portage/make.conf\nUSE=\"... samba\"\nSave and exit the file, then run the following commands.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge -avtDUu @world \nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask kio-extras \n  Install Spectacle For Screenshots \nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask spectacle \n  Install MPV and JuK for multimedia.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask mpv juk \n  Install Gwenview or qView for looking at photos.\nFor Gwenview:\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask gwenview\nFor qView:\nzoey@zelda ~ $ flatpak install qView  \nInstall Steam\nThis is somewhat involved. The easy route is just use the Flatpak, but depeneding on your system it could have issuses of its own.\nTo get native Steam, we need to add an overlay (a seperate repo with its own packages.) Run the below command\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask --noreplace app-eselect/eselect-repository\nEnable the steam repo using the following command.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo eselect repository enable steam-overlay\nThen sync the repos.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --sync\nSteam needs its own special USE flags to allow it to use 32-bit libraries. Open up the following package \nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo vim /etc/portage/package.use/steam\nAnd copy and paste in the following.\n\nx11-libs/libX11  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXau  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libxcb  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXdmcp  abi_x86_32\nvirtual/opengl  abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/mesa  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/expat  abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libglvnd  abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/zlib  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libdrm  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libxshmfence  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXext  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXxf86vm  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXfixes  abi_x86_32\napp-arch/zstd  abi_x86_32\nsys-devel/llvm  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXrandr  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libXrender  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libffi  abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/ncurses  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libxml2  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/icu  abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/gpm  abi_x86_32\nvirtual/libelf  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/elfutils  abi_x86_32\napp-arch/bzip2  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/nspr  abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/nss  abi_x86_32\nnet-libs/libndp  abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/extest abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libevdev abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/wayland abi_x86_32\nvirtual/rust abi_x86_32\ndev-lang/rust-bin abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/libpciaccess abi_x86_32\nsys-devel/clang abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/fontconfig abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/libudev-compat abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libpulse abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libsndfile abi_x86_32\nnet-libs/libasyncns abi_x86_32\nsys-apps/dbus abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/glib abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libpcre2 abi_x86_32\nsys-apps/util-linux abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/flac abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libogg abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libvorbis abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/opus abi_x86_32\nmedia-sound/lame abi_x86_32\nmedia-sound/mpg123-base abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/freetype abi_x86_32\nmedia-libs/libpng abi_x86_32\nvirtual/libintl abi_x86_32\nvirtual/libudev abi_x86_32\nsys-apps/systemd-utils abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/libcap abi_x86_32\nsys-libs/pam abi_x86_32\nvirtual/libiconv abi_x86_32\nx11-libs/xcb-util-keysyms abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libgpg-error abi_x86_32\napp-arch/lz4 abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libgcrypt abi_x86_32\nsys-apps/systemd abi_x86_32\n\nSave and exit. \nTo accept installing the steam package, open the following file.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo vim /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/steam\n*/*::steam-overlay\ngames-util/game-device-udev-rules\nsys-libs/libudev-compat\nSave and exit.\nWe need to re-emerge ncurses with gpm support.\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo USE=\"-gpm\" emerge --ask --oneshot sys-libs/ncurses \nInstall Steam:\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask games-util/steam-launcher\nRe-emerge gpm and ncurses\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask --oneshot sys-libs/ncurses gpm\nResource Monitoring\nTo install HTOP:\nzoey@zelda ~ $ sudo emerge --ask htop\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/gentoo-kde-and-windows-dualboot-guide/","title":"How I Setup Gentoo KDE/Windows 10 Dualboot."},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/test-blog/":{"body":"Hi!

Not only am I an active user of Linux, but I am also an active community member, trying to help other users. \nI have used a lot of Linux Distros (Different versions of the operating system that use the Linux Kernel, with lots of other software included ontop of it). My favourite Linux Distros are:\n\n\n  \n  Fedora Linux. \n  My preferred Linux Distro for the Desktop.

Home of the Plasma Desktop, and powerful apps like Krita, Kdenlive, KConnect and Kate.\n  \n\n    \n      \n      Sway \n    \n    \n    The first ever Window Manager I've used, thats as lightweight as it is tweakable and hackable, while keeping all the benefits of a modern Wayland Desktop.\n  \n\n    \n      \n      Flatpak \n    \n    \n    My favourite way of managing applications on Linux, allowing me to use a graphical app store to download any applications I need, that will work the exact same on any Linux Distro I use.\n  \n\n Linux Content Creators\nFor Linux news and information, I also like to listen to and watch these amazing Youtubers.\n   \n\n  The Linux Experiment.\n  https://thelinuxexp.com\n  \n\n\n  Nicco Loves Linux.\n  https://nicco.love\n  \n  \n\n  Veronica Explains.\n  https://vkc.sh\n  \n\n\n Personal System / Server Specs:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Computer Name.\n    \n    \n      \n       CPU.\n    \n    \n      \n       RAM.\n    \n    \n      \n       GPU.\n    \n    \n      \n       Storage.\n    \n    \n      \n       OS.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Main Gaming/Editing PC (Dell Optiplex 3080).\n    \n    \n      \n      Intel i5-10505.\n    \n    \n      \n      16GB.\n    \n    \n      \n      Radeon RX 6400XT.\n    \n    \n      \n      1TB HDD + 512GB SSD + 240GB SSD\n    \n    \n      \n      Fedora Workstation KDE 40\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Experiment Machine (HP Elitebook G20):\n    \n    \n      \n      Intel i5-4300U.\n    \n    \n      \n      8GB.\n    \n    \n      \n      Intel HD 4400\n    \n    \n      \n      320GB HDD\n    \n    \n      \n      Gentoo KDE / Windows 10\n    \n  \n\n\nGTK4/Libadwaita Development  \n\nUsing my knowledge in Rust and Python, and my love for GNOME and Libadwita apps, I am planning on making simple apps of my own that integrate well into the GNOME desktop.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/computingblog/","title":"Computing Blog."},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/contributers/":{"body":"\n\n  \n    \n    \n    The web site of zoeytheratspage\n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        [zoey@fedora:~]$ users █\n         A massive thank you to the following people for helping me shape my website.\n         Eryn: Hosting the website on blahaj.land.\n         The Evil Skeleton: Helping design the website and pointing out bugs and potential fixes.\n         Henry Hiles (Quadradical), Ziv, Ronnie, Luna: Helping find bugs and (numerous) spelling mistakes.\n        \n         All other contributers to my website can be found at My Websites Github Page.\n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/contributers/","title":"Contributers"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/plushieblog/":{"body":"\n\n[zoey@fedora:~]$ vim ~/Documents/plushie.lore █\n\n   \nUNDER RECONSTRUCTION!\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/plushieblog/","title":"Plushie Blog."},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mainPages/whoami/":{"body":"\n[zoey@fedora:~]$ whoami █\n About Me \nMy name is Zoey Ahmed. This is my personal corner, sharing all the things I get up to off-screen.\n\n  Music\n   Music is one of my favourite forms of escapism. I often like to listen to music while I work, or to disconnect from my online and work lives and listen to music I enjoy, to help me destress. I am generally a fan of metal, rock, electronic and grunge music, but I am open for whatever genre! \n   Below, I have some of my favourite artists, and a track from each that should give you a feel of that particular artist.
